### Search and Download demo
Use the OpenSearch interface of the Global Land product catalogue to discover the available product collections (datasets), search for products (data files) and download them.

Take a look at the interactive notebook (.ipynb) file first and explore it in your Jupyter notebook service.

The .py file is for running the notebook code as a stand-alone script in your Python coding environment.

To run the code, you'll need to have the latest version of Terracatalogueclient package installed (https://vitobelgium.github.io/terracatalogueclient/index.html).
